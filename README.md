# improcbase-cpp
The base project for opening, processing and storing images using C++ (Visual Studio 2015).
The project is provided for educational purpose.

The project provides the minimum possible functionality to work with images:

1. Templated image class with basic pixel access.
2. Two pixel types with a couple of overloaded operators as an example.
3. Loading and storing the images from/to file using GDI+ functions.
4. Demo function that converts the image to grayscale and performs horizontal mirroring.
